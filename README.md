# File-System-Simulator

Project Description:
File system simulator using C++ version 11. This program will simulate the basic functionalities of a file system, including file creation, deletion, reading, and writing operations. The simulator will allow users to interact with a virtual file system and perform file operations similar to those in a real file system.

Project Requirements Met:
1. File System Structure:
   - Designing and implementing a file system structure that supports file and directory management.
   - Each file should have a name, size, and content.
   - Each directory should have a name and contain files and subdirectories.

2. User Interface:
   - The program will display a menu with the following options:
     a) Create a file
     b) Create a directory
     c) Delete a file or directory
     d) List files and directories
     e) Read a file
     f) Write to a file
     g) Exit the program
   - The program will repeatedly prompt the user for a menu choice until the user chooses to exit.

3. File and Directory Operations:
   - Implements functions to create files and directories within the virtual file system.
   - Implements functions to delete files and directories from the virtual file system.
   - Implements a function to list the files and directories within a directory.
   - Implements functions to read the content of a file and write to a file.

4. Error Handling:
   - The program will handle errors gracefully, such as invalid file or directory names, attempting to read or write to a non-existent file, or any other potential issues.
   - Provides meaningful error messages to guide the user in case of errors.
